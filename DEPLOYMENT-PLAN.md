# Homelab Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step deployment plan for your homelab, ensuring each step results in a working service or meaningful progress toward the next stage.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: Image Factory Stack

**Goal**: Create standardized VM templates for all services

**What You'll Build**:

- Ubuntu 22.04 base template with Docker
- GPU-enabled template for transcoding
- Container host template for services

**Deliverable**: Working VM templates ready for service deployment

**Learning Outcomes**:

- Packer automation
- VM template creation
- Security hardening
- Docker installation

### Step 2: Basic Infrastructure

**Goal**: Set up core networking and storage

**What You'll Build**:

- VLAN configuration
- NFS storage setup
- Basic security (firewall, SSH)

**Deliverable**: Network and storage ready for services

## Phase 2: Core Services (Week 3-4)

### Step 3: Streaming Stack (Plex)

**Goal**: Working Plex server with GPU transcoding

**What You'll Build**:

- Plex VM using GPU template
- NFS storage configuration
- Tautulli monitoring
- Data migration from Docker

**Deliverable**: Fully functional Plex server with your existing media

**Migration Steps**:

1. Export current Plex data from Docker
2. Copy media files to NFS
3. Deploy new Plex VM
4. Restore configuration and database
5. Test all functionality

**Learning Outcomes**:

- GPU passthrough
- NFS storage
- Data migration
- Service deployment

## Phase 3: Security Foundation (Week 5-6)

### Step 4: Security Stack

**Goal**: Enterprise-grade security foundation

**What You'll Build**:

- Vault cluster for secrets
- SSL certificate management
- Traefik reverse proxy
- Basic zero trust networking

**Deliverable**: Secure infrastructure ready for applications

## Phase 4: Automation (Week 7-8)

### Step 5: Download Stack

**Goal**: Automated media acquisition

**What You'll Build**:

- Sonarr, Radarr, Overseerr
- Download automation
- Integration with Plex

**Deliverable**: Fully automated media pipeline

## Phase 5: Monitoring (Week 9-10)

### Step 6: Monitoring Stack

**Goal**: Complete observability

**What You'll Build**:

- Prometheus and Grafana
- Log aggregation
- Alerting system

**Deliverable**: Full monitoring and alerting

## Today's Goal: Working Plex Server

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Deploy Image Factory** (2-3 hours)

   - Create VM templates
   - Test template functionality
   - Document template usage

2. **Deploy Plex Stack** (3-4 hours)

   - Use GPU template for Plex VM
   - Configure NFS storage
   - Deploy Plex and Tautulli

3. **Data Migration** (1-2 hours)
   - Export current Plex data
   - Copy media to NFS
   - Restore configuration
   - Test functionality

### Expected Outcome

By the end of today, you'll have:

- ✅ Working Plex server with GPU transcoding
- ✅ All your existing media accessible
- ✅ Tautulli monitoring
- ✅ NFS storage for scalability
- ✅ Foundation for future services

## Learning Progression

### Week 1-2: Infrastructure

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Packer**: VM template automation
- **Proxmox**: Hypervisor management
- **Networking**: VLAN configuration

### Week 3-4: Services

- **Docker**: Container management
- **NFS**: Network storage
- **GPU**: Hardware acceleration
- **Migration**: Data movement

### Week 5-6: Security

- **Vault**: Secrets management
- **SSL**: Certificate automation
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy
- **Zero Trust**: Network security

### Week 7-8: Automation

- **CI/CD**: Jenkins pipelines
- **GitOps**: Version-controlled deployments
- **Monitoring**: Observability
- **Backup**: Data protection

## Success Criteria

### Each Phase Must Deliver:

1. **Working Service**: Functional end-to-end
2. **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage
3. **Learning**: New skills demonstrated
4. **Foundation**: Ready for next phase

### Quality Gates:

- All services accessible
- Security best practices
- Monitoring in place
- Backup procedures
- Documentation complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy:

- Export current Plex data before migration
- Test migration process
- Keep Docker setup as fallback
- Document rollback procedures

### Testing:

- Verify GPU transcoding works
- Test all media playback
- Validate remote access
- Check monitoring functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Image Factory** - Build the foundation
2. **Deploy Plex Stack** - Get your media working
3. **Test Everything** - Ensure full functionality
4. **Document Process** - Record what you learned
5. **Plan Next Phase** - Security foundation

This approach ensures you always have a working system while learning enterprise-grade practices!
